## What is HPC ?

- What is performance?
    - Efficiency of resource utilization
    - Time to solution ?
    - Energy to solution?
    - Algorithmic complexity?
- HPC modes
    - Research codes
        - Prototyping oriented
            - Short runs
            - Results are architecture related information
        - Scientific results
            - Long runs
            - Results independent from hardware
            - Lifetime depend on publication of results
    - Production application and
