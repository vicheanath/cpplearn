### C++ provides a wide range of data structures that can be used to implement efficient and robust algorithms. Here are some of the commonly used data structures in C++:

- [x] Arrays - A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
- [ ] Vectors - A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
- [ ] Linked Lists - A collection of nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node.
- [ ] Stacks - A collection of elements that allows access to only the last element inserted.
- [ ] Queues - A collection of elements that allows access to only the first element inserted.
- [ ] Trees - A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node having zero or more child nodes.
- [ ] Graphs - A collection of vertices and edges that represent connections between them.
- [ ] Hash Tables - A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values, providing constant time access.

When using these data structures, it's important to consider factors such as the efficiency of the operations performed on them, the memory usage, and the ease of implementation. By choosing the appropriate data structure for a specific problem, you can significantly improve the efficiency and readability of your code.
